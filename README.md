My Python Algorithms

- You can see my own notes and studies about the algorithm course, which is the basic course of computer engineering, which I took in the fall semester of the 1st year, in this repository.
- We didn't learn Python in school. I learned it myself before I started school. In this way, I was able to try the algorithms written in the paper we learned at school with Python and learn better.
- I also learned the algorithm just before learning Python.

- My Project Euler and LeetCode studies using Python and some of my research notes about Python are also in this repository.
